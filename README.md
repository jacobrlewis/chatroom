# Chatroom

This is a simple chatroom server and cli client. I am using this project to practice Go!

Chats are sent between client and server using the Gorilla Websocket package.

# Getting Started

## Running

Use something along the lines of
```
cd cmd/server
go run .
```
and
```

go run .
```

to run.
